block that affects a whole line
block that must touch 2 other types of blocks

block that affects doublers (change name) which increases effectiveness based on number of adjacent incrementors
	recursor

block that takes points from all adjacent incrementors? is that just doubling? 4 of these around an incrementor would mean incrementor points x5, 4 doublers would be incrementor points x16
subroutine
